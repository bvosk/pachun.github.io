I'm always listening to music, but I have a problem. When I find stuff I like, I
can listen to it on repeat for a long time. Whether a single song or a small playlist
of a couple more, I can go for days or weeks. Because I love music
(particularly mine), I carry around a jambox and subject others to that hell.

Everyone I went to school with knows this about me. In particular, they know me
for one small playlist which they call chune's tunes. It's been around since
freshman year of school and I still listen to it often.

Now that I'm done with school and the habit's annoying less people, I'm finding
it a little less fun. As a result, I'm making an effort to listen to more, new
music. I've committed to making new fifty song playlists every week using 
spotify radio. Fifty songs per week means I need to find and save ten new
songs I like every workday.

Most weeks I don't hit my goal and some weeks I don't even try; I run back to an
old playlist. I'm hoping that making this public will help
motivate me to not skip weeks and try harder to hit the fifty song goal.

I'll offer an explanation for the skipped weeks; [I found a really great playlist
with > 400
songs](https://open.spotify.com/user/kent1337/playlist/6IjDl5eRczFdgZkKYXhuHZ),
which took a couple weeks to digest. The goal was to discover and listen to new
music. Because I technically did that, not all of those weeks were failures. [If
you like any similar music, please share it with me](https://open.spotify.com/user/pachun91).
I like a lot of genres.
